# Blood Cell Counter using YoLo v7

This repository contains the code and data for a blood cell counter based on YoLo v7, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. The goal of this project is to provide a fast and accurate way to count and classify different types of blood cells from microscopic images.

## Getting Started

To get started with the blood cell counter, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch 1.13.0 or higher
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

# Model Details
The blood cell counter is based on YoLo v7, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm that can accurately detect and classify objects in images. The model is trained on a large dataset of microscopic blood cell images, which includes different types of blood cells such as red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The model is optimized for speed and accuracy, making it suitable for real-time blood cell counting in clinical settings.
